# make_gif
This program takes in 3 images as well as a desired speed in milliseconds and outputs a ".gif" file 

How it works:

1. In the command-line run the python file with python make_gif.py.
2. Before pressing enter make sure you add 3 images and the desired speed in milliseconds.
   
3. Example: python make_gif.py 0.jpg 1.jpg 2.jpg 1000
   
5. Press enter and the program will output a gif for you with the desired speed between images.


p.s: This one was fun to make. It's nice to see programs that have an impact outside of the terminal window.
